# Cortensor Sentinel Architecture

Cortensor Sentinel is an autonomous agentic monitoring system built on
Cortensor’s decentralized inference network.

## Core Flow

Observe → Infer (Cortensor) → Validate (PoI / PoUW) → Decide → Act

## Components

- Backend Agent Service
- Cortensor Router (Decentralized Inference)
- Validation Engine (Redundant Inference Scoring)
- Frontend Observability Dashboard
- Evidence Store (JSON)

## Trust Model

- Multiple miners run inference
- Agreement and usefulness scored
- Evidence artifacts produced
